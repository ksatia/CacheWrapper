    // we need to a. archive things to disk b. check for a way to determine if objects are expired (when you try to access, run a check) -> if expired, trash it
    // will be using archiver to write to disk (check for cache folder in documentation)
    // we will have multiple caches for different object types (a cache for GSMcoordinates, a cache for UIImages for a particular part of an application -> the easiest way to differentiate between caches holding similar objects would be by name. MUST HAVE A NAME PROPERTY
    // We need support for clearing out an entire cache by name
    // We need support for clearing out all caches
    // The cache that will be implemented is just an instance of NSCache (performance with hash functions) - should be internal constant since we don't want anybody importing the framework to have direct access to the internal structure
    //  Create a dispatch queue OR an NSOperation depending on what we end up doing with API response caching.
    // Consider using enum in CacheStore to determine how far off object expiration is. NSDate has NSDate.distanceFuture(), etc.
    //start by initializing a cache using the internal cache variable backed by NSCache (instance of that cache). A file manager object is just used as a wrapper around lower level I/O operations and directory access.

        // attribute name to both class property for cache name
        // NSCache has a name property already which seems to be used to differentiate between caches when a delegate method is called when objects are about to be evicted from the cache. This allows you to see which caches are evicting objects.
